<br>Guinea pigs say: "<em>wheek wheek wheeeeek!</em>"

<br> I used to have two guinea pigs, their names were:
<ol>
  <li>Red: was very energetic and always annoyed Blue.</li>
  <li>Blue: was a bit of a bully to Red. Was much older than Red and was the calm one in the duo.</li>
</ol>
<br> They loved bell peppers
